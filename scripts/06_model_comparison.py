# --- Step 5.2: Discussion of Pros and Cons ---
print("\n\nStep 5.2: Discussion of Pros and Cons of Each Model Type (Stock Forecasting Context)")

print("\n1. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):")
print("   Pros:")
print("     - Well-established, statistically grounded model.")
print("     - Effective for data with clear trends and autocorrelation when stationarized.")
print("     - Relatively simple to understand and interpret parameters (p,d,q).")
print("   Cons:")
print("     - Assumes stationarity (requires differencing for non-stationary data like stock prices).")
print("     - Primarily captures linear relationships; may not handle complex non-linear patterns well.")
print("     - Can be sensitive to outliers.")
print("     - Does not inherently handle external regressors easily without extensions (ARIMAX).")
print("     - Parameter selection (p,q) can be subjective if relying solely on ACF/PACF.")

print("\n2. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):")
print("   Pros:")
print("     - Extends ARIMA to explicitly model seasonality.")
print("     - Can be very effective if strong, regular seasonality is present.")
print("   Cons:")
print("     - All cons of ARIMA apply.")
print("     - Requires identifying the seasonal period (m) and seasonal parameters (P,D,Q).")
print("     - Can become complex and computationally intensive, especially with long seasonal periods (as seen with m=252).")
print("     - True, consistent seasonality in stock prices is often debated or weak compared to other factors.")

print("\n3. Prophet:")
print("   Pros:")
print("     - Developed by Facebook, designed for business forecasts with seasonality and holidays.")
print("     - Handles trends, multiple seasonalities (yearly, weekly, daily), and holidays effectively.")
print("     - Robust to missing data and outliers to some extent.")
print("     - Often works well with default parameters, requiring less tuning initially.")
print("     - Provides interpretable components (trend, seasonality, holidays).")
print("     - Allows for easy inclusion of custom seasonalities and regressors.")
print("   Cons:")
print("     - Can be a bit of a 'black box' if not delving into its underlying model (Bayesian structural time series).")
print("     - May not always outperform simpler models like ARIMA if patterns are very linear and non-seasonal, or if seasonality is not as Prophet models it.")
print("     - For highly volatile series like stocks, its default trend flexibility might sometimes overfit or underfit short-term movements if not tuned (e.g., changepoint_prior_scale).")

print("\n4. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network):")
print("   Pros:")
print("     - Capable of learning complex non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies in sequential data.")
print("     - Does not require data to be stationary (though scaling is essential).")
print("     - Can potentially model intricate patterns that linear models miss.")
print("     - Flexible architecture (number of layers, units, activation functions, etc.).")
print("   Cons:")
print("     - Requires more data than classical models to perform well and avoid overfitting.")
print("     - Computationally intensive to train, especially with many epochs or large networks.")
print("     - Can be a 'black box'; harder to interpret why it makes certain predictions.")
print("     - Prone to overfitting if not regularized properly (e.g., with Dropout).")
print("     - Hyperparameter tuning (network architecture, sequence length, epochs, batch size, learning rate) can be complex and time-consuming.")
print("     - Sensitive to data scaling.")
print("\nStep 5.2: Discussion of Pros and Cons completed.")

# --- Step 5.3: Model Tuning (Conceptual) ---
print("\n\nStep 5.3: Model Tuning (Conceptual)")

print("\nFurther tuning could potentially improve model performance. Examples:")
print("\n1. ARIMA/SARIMA:")
print("   - If auto_arima wasn't exhaustive, a more extensive grid search over (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,m) could be performed.")
print("   - For SARIMA, trying different seasonal periods (m) if yearly (m=252) is too problematic or not evident (e.g., m=21 for monthly, m=5 for weekly).")
print("   - Analyzing residuals more deeply for any remaining patterns.")

print("\n2. Prophet:")
print("   - Adjusting `changepoint_prior_scale`: Higher values make the trend more flexible, lower values make it stiffer.")
print("   - Adjusting `seasonality_prior_scale` for yearly, weekly seasonalities.")
print("   - Adding custom seasonalities if specific cycles are known (e.g., quarterly earnings).")
print("   - Incorporating known holidays relevant to stock markets (e.g., `add_country_holidays(country_name='US')`).")
print("   - Adding external regressors if relevant (e.g., VIX index, interest rates), though this complicates forecasting as future values of regressors are needed.")

print("\n3. LSTM:")
print("   - Experimenting with the network architecture:")
print("     - Number of LSTM layers (e.g., 1, 2, 3).")
print("     - Number of units per LSTM layer (e.g., 32, 50, 100, 128).")
print("     - Different types of recurrent layers (e.g., GRU).")
print("     - Amount of Dropout (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3).")
print("   - Varying the `sequence_length` (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days).")
print("   - Adjusting training parameters:")
print("     - Number of `epochs` (more epochs if not overfitting, fewer if overfitting early).")
print("     - `batch_size` (e.g., 16, 32, 64).")
print("     - Different `optimizers` (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) and `learning_rate`s.")
print("   - Using techniques like EarlyStopping during training to prevent overfitting.")
print("   - Trying bidirectional LSTMs or LSTMs with attention mechanisms for more complex patterns.")
print("   - Feature engineering: Including more input features (e.g., Volume, other technical indicators) if the LSTM architecture is adapted to handle multiple features per timestep.")

print("\nFor this project, we performed initial fits. Exhaustive hyperparameter tuning is a significant undertaking, often involving techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, and cross-validation (though time series cross-validation needs care, e.g., walk-forward validation).")
