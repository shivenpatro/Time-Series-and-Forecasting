# Presentation / Video Demonstration Outline: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting for AAPL Stock

## 1. Introduction (Approx. 5-10% of time)
    - **Hook/Problem Statement:** Briefly introduce the challenge and interest in stock price forecasting.
    - **Project Goal & Objectives:** Clearly state what the project aimed to achieve (analyze AAPL stock, apply various time series models, compare performance, forecast future trends).
    - **Stock Chosen:** Apple Inc. (AAPL) - and a brief reason if any (e.g., well-known, sufficient historical data).
    - **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the presentation structure (what you'll cover).

## 2. Data (Approx. 10-15% of time)
    - **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`).
    - **Data Description:** Period covered (e.g., ~10 years of daily data), features collected (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
    - **Initial Visualizations & EDA Highlights:**
        - Show the plot of AAPL 'Close' price over time â€“ discuss overall trend.
        - Briefly mention trading volume trends if interesting.
        - Show Moving Averages plot and what it indicates.
    - **Key Preprocessing Steps:**
        - Mentioning stationarity: Show original vs. differenced series plot and ADF test results (p-values).
        - Briefly touch upon time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual plot) and any insights (e.g., strong trend, weak/noisy seasonality for AAPL).

## 3. Methodology: Models Implemented (Approx. 30-40% of time)
    *(For each model type, briefly explain the concept, how parameters were chosen, and show key results/plots)*
    - **Data Splitting:** Explain the chronological train/test split (80/20). Show the split plot.
    - **ARIMA Model:**
        - Brief concept (AR, I, MA components).
        - How `d` was chosen (from ADF test).
        - Show ACF/PACF plots of differenced training data and how they inform `p`, `q`.
        - Mention `auto_arima` and the order it selected (e.g., ARIMA(1,1,1)).
        - Show plot of ARIMA predictions vs. actual test data.
        - State key performance metrics (RMSE, MAE).
    - **SARIMA Model (Briefly):**
        - Explain it extends ARIMA for seasonality.
        - Mention the attempt with `m=252` and the memory/computational challenge encountered. (This is a valid real-world finding).
    - **Prophet Model:**
        - Brief concept (additive model with trend, seasonality, holidays).
        - Show Prophet's forecast plot (with `yhat`, `yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`).
        - Show Prophet's components plot (trend, weekly/yearly seasonality if detected).
        - State key performance metrics (RMSE, MAE).
    - **LSTM Model:**
        - Brief concept (deep learning for sequential data, ability to capture non-linearities).
        - Key data preparation steps: Scaling, sequence creation (e.g., 60-day lookback).
        - Briefly describe the LSTM architecture used (e.g., 2 LSTM layers, Dropout, Dense output).
        - Show plot of training/validation loss (if it looks good and shows learning).
        - Show plot of LSTM predictions vs. actual test data.
        - State key performance metrics (RMSE, MAE).

## 4. Results & Model Comparison (Approx. 15-20% of time)
    - **Performance Metrics Table:** Display the table comparing RMSE and MAE for all models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, SARIMA-error).
    - **Discussion of Best Model:** Clearly state which model performed best (LSTM) and by how much.
    - **Visual Comparison:** Perhaps show the actual vs. predicted plots for the best model (LSTM) and the best classical model (ARIMA) side-by-side or sequentially for emphasis.

## 5. Final Forecast & Conclusion (Approx. 10-15% of time)
    - **Final Forecast Plot:** Show the plot of historical data with the LSTM model's 30-day future forecast.
    - **Summary of Key Findings:** Reiterate the main takeaways (e.g., LSTM superiority, challenges with SARIMA m=252, nature of AAPL stock data).
    - **Limitations of the Project/Models:**
        - Stock market is highly complex; models are simplifications.
        - Forecasts are probabilistic, not deterministic certainties.
        - Sensitivity to hyperparameters, training data period.
        - External factors (news, economic events) not included in these univariate models.
    - **Potential Future Work:** Briefly mention ideas from Step 5.3 (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, multivariate models, deploying the model).

## 6. Q&A (If applicable)

**Tips for Presentation:**
- Keep slides clean and uncluttered.
- Use visuals (plots!) extensively.
- Explain concepts clearly but concisely.
- Focus on the story: what was the problem, what did you do, what did you find, what does it mean?
- Practice your timing.

This outline provides a good structure for a comprehensive presentation of your project.
